                  From a young age, I learned people experience the world differently, and that
                  these experiences shape the way people perceive and interact with the world.
                </p>
                <p className=''>
                  Born and raised in San Jose, I come from a refugee family of the Vietnam War.
                  Growing up with a grandmother with dementia and a permanently disabled father, I
                  spent most of my time as their caregiver. As a result, I learned to be empathetic,
                  observant, and aware as I tried to understand my environment and the people in it.
                </p>
                <p className=''>
                  For most of my childhood, my keen sense of awareness highlighted how different I
                  was from my peers. Not feeling like I belonged, I found an escape and passion in
                  technology and computers.
                </p>
                <p className=''>
                  In high school, I spent two years in photography developing an eye for design.
                  Some of my most fond experiences from high school were the hours I spent inside
                  the darkroom developing film.
                </p>
                <p className=''>
                  In college, I learned to channel my empathy into compassion. This call to service
                  became especially clear to me when I devoted most of my time trying to make a
                  change in my fraternity, sacrificing my own academics in the process. In 2018, I
                  graduated from UC Davis with a B.S degree in Computational Cognitive Science, an
                  interdisciplinary field that allowed me to study both of my childhood passions:
                  computer science and psychology.
                </p>
                <p className=''>
                  Since then, I&apos;ve been studying, learning, refining my eye for design to
                  become a skilled UX designer and developer. After a few years of hard work, I
                  finally feel ready for full time opportunities to begin the next chapter in my
                  career. As a UX generalist, I&apos;m able to play a flexible support role,
                  adapting to the needs of the team.
                </p>
                <p className=''>
                  I&apos;m a curious person that&apos;s always striving to learn more. I&apos;m a
                  generalist with a strong desire for mastery and excellence. Outside of work, I
                  enjoy film and digital photography, pretending Iâ€™m a DJ, spending time out in
                  nature, and immersing myself in different cultures. I&apos;m also an avid Formula
                  1 fan and PC gamer.
